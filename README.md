## Lexvars
A package for generating variables for word recognition research, primarily
from the CELEX corpus but from other resources as well.

Please see [lexvars_tutorial.html](http://rawgit.com/TalLinzen/LexVars/master/lexvars_tutorial.html) for additional information.

The `data/subcat` subdirectory has pregenerated verb subcategorization
distributions from VALEX; those may be useful if you don't have access
to the original corpus.
