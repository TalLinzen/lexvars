## Lexvars
A package for generating variables for word recognition research:

* Morphological variables from CELEX
* Subcategorization frame variables from VALEX
* Word vectors from the British National Corpus

Please see
[lexvars_tutorial.html](http://rawgit.com/TalLinzen/LexVars/master/lexvars_tutorial.html)
for additional information.

The `data/subcat` subdirectory has pregenerated verb subcategorization
distributions from VALEX; those may be useful if you don't have access
to the original corpus.
